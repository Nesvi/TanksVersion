---EXPLOSIVE BALLS
---  A circle of 8 explosive spheres that bounce with the environment. 
---They explode in 3 seconds so other players need to move quickly to avoid them.
---There's feedback about when the explosion is going to start, the red blinking light. 
---
---BARRIER
---A barrier that players can use to block paths or stop bullets from their front side. 
---They need to aim to the direction they want to protect
---
---BARREL
---An explosive barrel with two spears that you can use to stick it to other players. 
---When it's stick there're a few seconds before the explosion start. The victim's tank can 
---chase the attacker tank to make him explode too.
---This is my favourite one because it has a lot of posibilities and I believe it's fun.
---The key elements for this game are chasing, driving and position based abilities IMHO.
---
---BLADES 
---Two blades appear on the tank sides. The player has 7 seconds to try to hit other tanks with
---the blades. They deal 50 points of damage. This ability promotes chasing & fly behaviours.
---
---Magnet
---When the player activates it a respulsion force affects other tanks. It's useful to try to 
---stick them to a wall or getting distance with your attackers.
